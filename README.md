# Fipy_MQ_mqtt
 
This is just a DIY project to use a MQ7 / MQ2 sensor that I found lying around in my house, to track CO, LPG gas concentrations and publish it on a local MQTT broker using a pycom WiPy or Fipy board. The gas sensing code is from kartun83 (github account) and can be found here: https://github.com/kartun83/micropython-MQ/tree/master .
The gas sensing MQ codes have been modified so it can be run on a PyCom device. 

I AM CURRENTLY NOT SURE ABOUT THE ACCURACY OF MY SENSOR VALUES AND AM FINDING IT HARD TO CALIBRATE IT. SO, THIS IS JUST A WORK IN PROGRESS.
